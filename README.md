# AtomVM DHT Driver

The AtomVM Nif can be used to drive DHT11 and DHT12 temperature and humidity sensors that can be attached to ESP32 SoCs.

This driver is included as an add-on to the AtomVM base image.  In order to use this driver, you must be able to build the AtomVM virtual machine, which in turn requires installation of the Espressif IDF SDK and tool chain.

Documentation for this component can be found in the following sections:

* [Programmer's Guide](markdown/dht.md)
* [Example Program](examples/dht_example/README.md)
