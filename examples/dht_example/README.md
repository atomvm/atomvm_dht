# AtomVM DHT Example Program

Welcome to the `dht_example` AtomVM application.

This example application will drive a DHT11 or DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor attached to an ESP32 device using a single data wire and print readings to the console.

The `dht_example` program illustrates use of the DHT API by taking a temperature and humidity reading every 30 seconds, and displaying the result on the console.

For this application, you will need:

* An ESP32 device, flashed with the [AtomVM](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM) image (including the VM and core libraries), containing the `atomvm_dht` Nif, and capable of connecting via UART to your development machine;
* A DHT11 or DHT22 device, typically marketed as an integrated development board;
* The [`esptool.py`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) tool (for flashing);
* The [`git`](https://git-scm.com) version control tool;
* [Erlang/OTP 21](https://www.erlang.org) or higher, along with [`rebar3`](https://www.rebar3.org);
* A serial monitor program of your choice (e.g, [`minicom`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom))

> Note that you will need to build a version of the AtomVM virtual machine that includes the `atomvm_dht` Nif.

## Getting Started

### Connection

To run this example program, connect the positive (+) lead on the DHT device to +3.3v power on the ESP32, the negative lead (-) to a ground pin on the ESP32, and the data pin to GPIO pin 22 on the ESP32 device.

                                            +-----------+

### Build Instructions

To build and flash this application to your ESP32 device, issue the `esp32_flash` target to the `rebar3` command, and optionally specify the device port and baud rate, if they do not match the defaults.

> Note.  For information about the `esp32_flash` target, see the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://atomvm.github.io/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) instructions.

    shell$ rebar3 atomvm esp32_flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
